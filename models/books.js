Think and Grow Rich has been listed in John C. Maxwell’s a lifetime ‘must read’ books list, and also ranked as the sixth best-selling paperback business book years after it was first published by business week Magazine’s best-seller list. This edition comes with a ribbon bookmark, gilded edges and beautiful endpapers. Ideal to be read and treasured, it makes for a perfect addition to any library."
